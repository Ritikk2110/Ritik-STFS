This is a fantastic development\! Based on the URL you provided, your project is not a general social network, but a specialized application called **Smart Things Finder System (STFS)**, a campus Lost & Found assistant.

I've integrated the project's real purpose with the technical details I know about your PHP/MySQL code to create a comprehensive `README.md` file.

# üéì Ritik-STFS: Smart Things Finder System 

A full-stack web application designed to serve as a **Campus Lost & Found Assistant**. This system simplifies the process of reporting, searching, and recovering lost and found items for students, staff, and campus visitors, promoting a more organized and responsible community.

The project is built as part of my IT Engineering coursework, focusing on practical database management, secure user handling, and dynamic web functionality.

## ‚ú® Project Highlights & Features

| Feature Category | Description | Technical Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Functionality** | **Report Lost Item:** Quickly submit details of a misplaced item. | `add_post.php` logic adapted for item reporting. |
| | **Report Found Item:** Upload details and images of an item found on campus. | Handles file uploads and sanitization on the server. |
| | **Search Database:** Instantly browse and filter items reported as lost or found. | Requires database querying and filtering logic. |
| **User Management** | Secure **Sign Up** and **Login/Logout** functionality. | Uses PHP Sessions and password hashing (`$2y$10...`). |
| | **Profile Editing:** Users can update their personal details and profile picture. | Implemented via AJAX using `edit_profile.php`. |
| **Interactivity** | **Post Actions:** Functionality for liking/disliking posts (which can be repurposed for verifying or confirming item reports). | Uses AJAX calls to `like_post.php`. |
| **Security Focus** | Implements basic input validation and sanitization (`htmlspecialchars`, `filter_var`) to mitigate **XSS** and ensure data integrity. | Used throughout the backend scripts. |
