  <strong>About Smart Things Finder System</strong> <br />
  Smart Things Finder System is a digital platform designed to help individuals
  quickly and efficiently report, search, and recover lost and found items
  within a campus or institution.<br>
  <strong>Our mission is simple:</strong> <br />
  To bridge the gap between people who lose things and those who find
  them—through technology, trust, and teamwork.
</p>
<p>
  In most institutions, the lost and found process is outdated, manual, and
  often inefficient. We built this system to modernize and simplify that
  experience. Instead of checking notice boards or asking around, students and
  staff can now use our platform to instantly log reports and find matches for
  lost and found items.
